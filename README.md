## Alzheimer's Disease Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis using MRI Data

### Project Summary:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset, which includes MRI data of the brain from young, middle-aged, nondemented, and demented older adults.
Utilized Python programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Developed machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to predict Alzheimer's disease based on MRI data.
Evaluated the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation.
Presented findings and insights from the analysis, contributing to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease prediction using MRI data.

### Key Achievements:
Successfully applied machine learning techniques to a complex medical dataset for Alzheimer's disease prediction.
Developed and implemented algorithms for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Enhanced understanding of the potential of MRI data in predicting neurodegenerative diseases.

### Technologies Used:
Python
Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC)
Data Analysis and Visualization (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Impact:
The project contributes to the field of neuroscience by exploring the use of MRI data in predicting Alzheimer's disease, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and intervention.
The findings may have implications for future research and clinical practice in neurology and neuroimaging.
